# Profitable App Profiles

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aolives/Profitable-App-Profiles/HEAD)

In this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what types of apps are likely to attract more users.

More than anything else this project exists to show you that I am familiar with:

- Data Concepts
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
